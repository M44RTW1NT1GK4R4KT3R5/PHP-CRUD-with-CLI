# How to set up the project

**Using docker is the recommended way to run this project. You can still run the project without docker but this is discouraged.**

 1. Clone the project from `https://github.com/M44RTW1NT1GK4R4KT3R5/PHP-CRUD-with-CLI.git`

 2. Create a database in your MySQL server

 3. Change the serverhost, username and password variables in `components/data/parameters.ini` to your local settings

 4. run `php components/console create/table` in your terminal to create the table
